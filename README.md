AFFeedsReader is very complete. It includes a feeds reader (obviously), pull to refresh, image downloader with cache, loading activity indicator...
It works like magic: just put your RSS URL. I'm working on the desing and performance. 
I've used third party frameworks for some features:

-Pull to refresh: [r2h]: https://github.com/Sephiroth87/ODRefreshControl

-Image Downloader: [r2h]: https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage

-Loading activity indicator: [r2h]: https://github.com/jdg/MBProgressHUD
